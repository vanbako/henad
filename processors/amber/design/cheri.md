# CHERI for Amber (24-bit BAU, 48-bit addressing)

## Goals

- Spatial memory safety with capabilities on a tiny in-order core.
- Keep Amberâ€™s BAU (24-bit) and 48-bit addressing model intact.
- No MMU/virt and no speculation; checks happen before side effects.

## Capability Model

- Width: 128-bit capability plus an architectural tag bit.
- Fields (conceptual):
  - `base` (48): BAU address of the region start
  - `length` (48): BAU length of the region
  - `cursor` (48): BAU address for the current access (relative to base)
  - `perms`: includes at least `R` (read), `W` (write), `X` (execute), `LC` (load capability), `SC` (store capability), `SB` (setbounds)
  - `sealed` bit and `otype`
  - `tag`: valid/invalid (cleared on non-cap stores except where `SC` is set)

Notes

- A compressed internal encoding is allowed; the architectural view is as above.
- All addresses and lengths are in BAUs (24-bit words). Sub-BAU addressing is not supported.

## Register Sets

- Data registers: `D0..D15` (16 Ã— 24-bit).
- Special registers (48-bit): `LR`, `SSP`, `PSTATE`, `PC`.
- Capability registers: `CR0..CR3` (128-bit + tag).
  - Default capabilities (CSR): `PCC` (code), `DDC` (default data), `SCC` (shadow-call stack).

## Capability Checks

Performed in MA/MO (memory) and fetch path (via `PCC`):

- Tag must be set.
- `cursor + access_width` within `[base, base+length)` (BAU-granular).
- `perms` must grant the operation (`R` for load, `W` for store, `LC/SC` for cap load/store).
- Sealed/type rules:
  - Data access on sealed caps is a fault.
  - `CSEAL`/`CUNSEAL` require `SB`/`S` perms and appropriate `otype`.
- Alignment: BAU aligned (24-bit); double-BAU ops require even BAU index.
- On violation: raise software interrupt; write cause into `PSTATE.cause`.

## Default Capabilities

- `PCC`: bounds the executable image. Instruction fetch must be within `PCC` and `X`-permitted.
- `DDC`: fallback data capability when an instruction does not name a `CRs` (Amberâ€™s ISA names one explicitly in LD/ST).
- `SCC`: bounds the shadow call stack region; used by call/return micro-ops with `SSP` as the cursor.

PC and PCC

- `PC` (SR, 48-bit) and `PCC.cursor` are kept equal by hardware. Control-flow instructions update both; changing `PCC` via CSR updates the fetch path and synchronizes `PC` at a defined boundary (e.g., after XT). Software should not attempt to desynchronize them.

SR vs. CSR

- `LR`, `SSP`, `PSTATE`, and `PC` exist as architectural Special Registers (SR) for fast access by micro-ops and control flow.
- CSR provides privileged mirrors of these SRs (see `csr.md` at 0x000â€“0x009) for inspection and kernel control. User-mode writes are not honored; kernel-mode may write subject to architectural rules.

## ISA Overview (CHERI-relevant)

- Loads/Stores (opclass 0100): `LDcso #offs(CRs), DRt` and `STcso DRs, #offs(CRt)`.
  - Signed offsets; BAU-granular; `perms.R`/`perms.W` required.
  - Capability loads/stores: `CLDcso`/`CSTcso` use `LC`/`SC` perms and move a full capability to/from `CRt`.
- Capability ops (opclass 0101): move/manipulate capabilities.
  - `CMOV CRs, CRt` â€” move capability (tag-preserving)
  - `CINC CRs, DRu, CRt` â€” `CRt.cursor = CRs.cursor + sign_extend(DRu)`
  - `CINCi #imm12, CRt` â€” immediate variant
  - `CSETB CRs, DRu, CRt` â€” set bounds to a length (perms `SB`)
  - `CSETBi #imm12, CRt` â€” immediate variant
  - `CGETP CRs, DRt` â€” extract perms mask to `DRt`
  - `CANDP DRs, CRt` â€” and perm mask (K-only if increasing perms)
  - `CSEAL CRs, CRseal, CRt` â€” seal with otype (needs `S`)
  - `CUNSEAL CRs, CRseal, CRt` â€” unseal (needs `S`)
  - `CGETT CRs, DRt` â€” get tag (1/0)
  - `CCLRT CRt` â€” clear tag (invalidate)
  - `CLDcso #offs(CRs), CRt` â€” load capability from memory into CRt (proposed Âµ-seq)
  - `CSTcso CRs, #offs(CRt)` â€” store capability from CRs to memory (proposed Âµ-seq)
- Control flow (opclass 0110): `JSR/RET` leverage `SCC` and `SSP` for the shadow stack, with `BTP` pads.
  - Indirect jumps/calls must be within a valid executable capability (via `PCC`); otherwise a capability-exec fault.
- Arithmetic trap-on-overflow: variants of ADD/SUB (signed) raise a software interrupt if `V=1`.

## Faults (Software Interrupt Causes)

- `CAP_OOB`: out-of-bounds access
- `CAP_TAG`: tag cleared (invalid)
- `CAP_PERM`: missing permission (`R/W/X/LC/SC`)
- `CAP_SEAL`: sealed/type violation
- `CAP_ALIGN`: misalignment for the access width
- `ARITH_OVF`: signed overflow (trap-on-overflow variants)
- `DIV_ZERO`: divide-by-zero
- `EXEC_PERM`: fetch without execute permission in `PCC`
 - `ARITH_RANGE`: shift count out of range (â‰¥ 24)
 - `UIMM_STATE`: use of `..ui` instruction without valid `LUIui` bank state

The exact encoding of causes is reported in `PSTATE.cause` and surfaced via the software interrupt vector.

## Proposed CLD/CST Micro-ops and Memory Layout

Amberâ€™s memory path supports 24/48-bit accesses today. A full architectural capability is >128 bits (3Ã—48 + 24 + 24 + 1 = 193b). We propose a packed, BAU-friendly layout and a simple Âµ-sequence using existing 48-bit SR load/store micro-ops.

Memory layout (12×24-bit words, written as six 48-bit lanes; the low 24-bit half carries the architectural field and the upper half is zero unless noted):
- [0] BASE_LO24, [1] BASE_HI24
- [2] LEN_LO24,  [3] LEN_HI24
- [4] CUR_LO24,  [5] CUR_HI24
- [6] PERMS_LO24, [7] PERMS_HI24 (currently zero; stored via 48-bit lane)
- [8] ATTR_LO24,  [9] ATTR_HI24 (currently zero)
- [10] TAG_LO24 (bit0 = architectural tag, remaining bits zero)
- [11] TAG_HI24 (reserved; currently zero)

µ-sequence expansion (in `stg2xt`) for `CSTcso CRs, #off(CRt)`:
- EX: compute `eff = CRt.cur + off`; check `tag && !sealed && SC && in-bounds` on CRt.
- Field order: {BASE, LEN, CUR, PERMS, ATTR, TAG}. Each macro step emits a 48-bit SR transfer; 24-bit fields occupy the low half and zero the upper half, while the tag lane sets bit0 and keeps the remaining bits clear.
  1. Emit new µ-op `CR2SR fld, CRs, SRtmp` to present the selected field on `SRtmp`.
  2. Emit `SRSTso SRtmp, #k(PC)` to write the 48-bit lane at `eff + k`. (Offsets advance in steps of two BAUs because each lane spans two 24-bit words.)
- TAG lane: drive bit0 high via `SRtmp`; the high 24-bit word remains zero for future extensions.

µ-sequence for `CLDcso #off(CRs), CRt` (reverse of above):
- EX: compute `eff = CRs.cur + off`; check `tag && !sealed && LC && in-bounds` on CRs.
- For each lane, emit `SRLDso SRtmp, #k(PC)` to fetch the 48-bit value, then `SR2CR fld, SRtmp, CRt` to update CRt. The low 24 bits populate the architectural field; the high 24-bit half is ignored (reserved).

Notes
- The `CR2SR/SR2CR` micro-ops are narrow, single-cycle register transfers between the CR file and the SR port in EX, with writeback in WB (mirroring existing SR/AR paths). They reuse the new CR writeback bus already present for CHERI ops.
- Back-to-back 48-bit `SRLDso/SRSTso` are already supported; MA/MO alternate ports to keep timing simple.
- A compressed alternative (8Ã—24-bit) can combine PERMS+ATTR into 48b and fold TAG into ATTR[0]; in that case TAG_24 and RESERVED_24 are omitted.

## Syscall vs. Software Interrupt

- Syscall: `SYSCALL #idx` transfers to kernel via a sealed entry capability and does not use the SWI path.
- Software interrupts are reserved for faults and explicit trap-on-overflow arithmetic.

## Encoding Notes

- To keep encoding compact and compatible with existing field widths, `CR` indices reuse the former `AR` 2-bit fields (`CR0..CR3`). The design can be extended in a future encoding revision if more `CR` are needed.
- DR fields remain 4 bits, but `D15` is reserved and must encode zero in well-formed programs (hardware may trap on `D15`).
